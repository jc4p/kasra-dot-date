I blog semi-often. Some of the hits:

- [Some Things That Make Me Scared](http://kasrarahjerdi.com/2016/11/some-things-that-make-me-scared/)

    A piercing light through my insecurities and fears. Written shortly after election day.

- [What Is Masculinity?](https://medium.com/@jc4p/what-is-masculinity-5559ed35dd64)

    I've gotten in a lot of weird uncomfortable situations due to my personal definition of masculinity and what it means to be a man.

- [Being an emotional man is a gift and a curse](https://medium.com/@jc4p/being-an-emotional-man-is-a-gift-and-a-curse-bffbdee9297)

    Kind of a year-in-review. Discusses a lot of the mental models I use daily to help me deal with the terrifying beast that is "other people".

- [The process is part of failure](https://medium.com/@jc4p/the-process-is-part-of-failure-e4fcc05e8979)

    Phew. A lot less emotional than the rest. An examination on how to deal with the Critical Inner Self in a perfectionist like me.

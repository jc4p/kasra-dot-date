    All the music I've listened to since 2006. Want to see exactly what I'm listening to, right now? Or a list of [my favorite artists](http://www.last.fm/user/pvam/library/artists?date_preset=ALL) (hint david bowie is #1).

- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20895385-kasra-rahjerdi)

    Goodreads is like Last.fm, but for books. I'm constantly reading, mostly non-fiction, sometimes textbooks.
